# Index, Show, New, Create Lab

## Objectives

1. Build a RESTful index action
2. Build a RESTful show action
3. Build a RESTful new action
4. Build a RESTful create action
5. Interlink pages using route helpers
6. Use route helpers in redirect_to
7. Build a new form with form_tag

## Notes

Give students a bare bone rails app without any models.

They will need to:

create the post model
build index with views linking to show
build show post with views linking to index
index should link to new_post
new_post should provide a working form with form_tag that goes to posts#create
posts#create should work and should redirect to posts show
ultimately this is the basic for creating and managing data - index, show, new, create. All interlinking correctly.
